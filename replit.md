# Advanced AI Text Summarizer

## Overview

The Advanced AI Text Summarizer is a sophisticated web application built with Streamlit that transforms long articles into concise summaries using sequence-to-sequence transformer models. The application implements true abstractive summarization - generating new text rather than just extracting existing sentences. It provides multiple model options, batch processing capabilities, and comprehensive metrics tracking with a professional interface.

## User Preferences
